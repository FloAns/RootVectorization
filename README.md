# Rooted_Soil-Tomograph_Image-Processing
Rep on image processing - Rooted soil observed in vivo in 4D through x-ray CT

The repository contains all the pyhon scripts needed to replicate the results presneted in Anselmucci et al. 2021a,b.
The tomography images need to be .tif files.

steps to follow:
1.Volume registartion with respect to the whole set of images is available.
2. Soil and root segmentation
3. Root skletonization
4. Root vectorialization
5. Water content and porosity fiels
6. Detection of grain rotations, and rogod dispalments of the bulk volume.
